Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my submission for the first homework for the online course CS50: Web Programming with Python and Javascript.

I decided to make my page a personal webpage where I showcase my work and write about things that I find interesting.

Most of the links on index.html will lead to a site that says "Under Construction" for now, with the exception links that read: "Who am I?", "cs50 and the current pandemic", "Home", and "Table of countries I've been to", which I put effort into writing. The "contact me" links link to external sites, and the "My resume" link just links to a PDF file I uploaded.
