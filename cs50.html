        <p>On March 9th, 2020, the government of Qatar announced that all educational institutions including universities and schools in the country were to be closed until further notice. I was in the building of my university when I heard the news that day and didn't think much of it: people were saying the building would be shut down for two weeks and everything would be back to normal. If anything I was excited at this new turn of events, addinig a little bit of an "interesting twist" to our routine lives. I certainly did not expect to be writing about it two months later, never having been back inside the campus since. Had I known it would turn out like this, maybe I would have visited some of the memorable locations within the campus one last time.
        <br/><br/>
        The next few days saw a progression of rules that closed down businesses and prevented social gatherings. People took to social media to share excited posts of news around the world as COVID-19 became more serious of an issue globally. I was an active participant too, waking up every morning (or night) to check the number of cases around the world and watching videos that explained the importance of social distancing to "flatten the curve".
        <br/><br/>
        But as days became weeks and weeks became days, I realized that I lacked routine in this self-isolated lifestyle I had failed to recognize as my new life. This became especially true once our online semester was over and we all graduated virtually: without any homework or classes to keep me organized, I spent most of my days playing chess and watching Community with no overall structure to when each thing was done. I had other general interests like exercising, learning Japanese, or reading a book ("The sense of an ending" by Julian Barnes, a great read!), but without structure it was impossible to realize these goals.
        <br/><br/>
        That was, until a friend introduced me to a bunch of online classes that Harvard was offering because of the pandemic! (Disclaimer: I don't know if it's really because of the pandemic, but my friend said so). I looked through the list of courses offered and CS50's Web Programming course quickly caught my attention. Web development is something I've always felt that I needed at various times, like when I've taken part in Hacakthons or those times when I've created code to automate bioinformatics related tasks that were dying to be made more accessible for others to access easily. 
        <br/><br/>
        And so, here I am, making myself a personal website for my first project homework! I have no idea how to arrange content or what I even really want to do but I think it'll be incredibly helpful in the future when I need a space to put all my thoughts, even if it's just for myself!
        <br/><br/>
        And how does CS50 help me organize my day and persue other goals, I here you ask? I think that having something productive to do can make you so efficient as you find more purpose to life on a daily basis. Like my professor used to say, "You find you have more time to do things when you're busier". It reminds me of my time in college and the pleasure I grew to have in fitting more tasks on my busy calendar. I hope that CS50 has a similar effect, where I am more excited to go about my day simply by having more things to work on and do in a day.
