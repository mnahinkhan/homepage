        <p class="headings">Biologist in love with math</p>
        <p>My undergraduate degree was in biological sciences. While I think it's crazy that a ribosome just scans a molecule to spit out just the right proteins, my childhood has been defined by a deep fascination and love for math. As my math professor used to say: "The universe may die one day but mathematical truths; mathematical truths are eternal truths!". I feel blessed to be a part of a species that gained the consciousness necessary to realize these truths (yes I can't get over the fact that the square root of 2 is irrational, can you?).</p>


        <p class="headings">Chess player</p>
        <p>Sometimes (very often) I like to play chess online! I used to play sometimes when I was young but I never realized it was a deep and well studied field in its own right; I just love the fact that there have been studies of this game for so many centuries that are relevant to this day. I enjoy watching videos about historical chess figures and theories on openings and endgames; the recent developments in artificial intelligence are also really interesting and very telling of our relationship with computers.</p>


        <p class="headings">Upcoming chef</p>
        <p>I started cooking in 2019 Fall. I can now cook scrambled eggs and pasta. I don't think the world is ready for me to be honest.</p>


        <p class="headings">Mixed culture boy</p>
        <p>Born and raised in various places around the world including Japan, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia by parents originally from Pakistan, I have had a unique upbringing that has allowed me to experience different cultures around the world! Maybe not so unique these days, but still very fascinating at times to think about how societies around the world can be very different despite globalization!</p>
