        <p class="headings">Biologist in love with math</p>
        <p>My undergraduate degree was in biological sciences. While I think it's crazy that a ribosome just scans a molecule to spit out just the right proteins, my childhood has been defined by a deep fascination and love for math. As my math professor used to say: "The universe may die one day but mathematical truths; mathematical truths are eternal truths!". I feel blessed to be a part of a species that gained the consciousness necessary to realize these truths (yes I can't get over the fact that the square root of 2 is irrational, can you?).</p>
        <p class="headings">Chess player</p>
        <p>Sometimes (very often) I like to play chess online! I used to play sometimes when I was young but I never realized it was a deep and well studied field in its own right; I just love the fact that there have been studies of this game for so many centuries that are relevant to this day. I enjoy watching videos about historical chess figures and theories on openings and endgames; the recent developments in artificial intelligence are also really interesting and very telling of our relationship with computers.</p>
        <p class="headings">Upcoming chef</p>
        <p>I started cooking in 2019 Fall. I can now cook scrabled eggs and pasta. I don't think the world is ready to be honest.</p>
